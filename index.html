      <h2>IESEG School of Management</h2>
        IESEG is a business school that offers many programs including the one I follow: the "Grandes Ecoles" program. It takes place over five years of learning and practice through internships and international exchanges. Learning about trade is very rewarding thanks to the acquisition of many skills worked on in different subjects.

      <h2>Projets</h2>
      <p>
        Today I want to work later in auditing or finance. These are two areas that I really like. I particularly like auditing which is a difficult but exciting field, I find that these professions are very complete. I have been discovering this subject since the second semester, which reinforces my desire to work in auditing.
